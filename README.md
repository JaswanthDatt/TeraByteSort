# TeraByteSort
Performance analysis of Sorting Terabyte data </br>
<b> Introduction </b></br>
In this project we have run performance analysis on Sorting TeraByte of data on a local machine using Apache Hadoop with configuration
<u><li>Centos OS</li>
<li>Memory 4GB</li>
<li>No of Cores:1</li>
<li>HDD:62GB,later Expanded to 100 GB</li>
</u>
</br> Due to memory and device constraints,we have run the terasort till 10GB data.

TeraGen.java,TeraSort.java,TeraValidate.java are the files from Apache Hadoop examples.
TeraGen.java generates bytes of data in MB/GB/TB based on input given.We have generated data from 1MB to 10GB.
TeraSort.java sort the data bytes that has been generated by the tereGen.TeraVaidate.java validated the sort result from teraSort.java.

We have also increased the no of cores of processor from 1 to 8 sore to analyze the effect on teraSort performance.The results point that as no of cores increase,the time taken to sort data bytes decreases.
